Lecture notes from a statistics course I teach at Potsdam

*Introductory Statistics*

This is a graduate level course for linguistics students at Potsdam. It introduces frequentist statistics from the ground up, without using too much mathematics.

A pdf is provided for those not willing to compile it themselves.
